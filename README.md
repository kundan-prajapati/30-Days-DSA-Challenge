# 30-Days-DSA-Challenge
Solving 1 LeetCode DSA question daily using C++


Day 1: Two Sum
Problem Description:
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, find indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
Approach:
    -> Used a simple brute force method with nested loops
    -> Time Complexity: O(n²) — due to nested loops checking all pairs
    -> Space Complexity: O(1) — only a few extra variables used, no extra data structures
    -> Prints the first valid pair of indices and values if found
    -> Prints message if no valid pair exists
